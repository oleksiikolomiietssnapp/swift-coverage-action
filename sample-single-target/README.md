# Single Target Sample

A minimal Swift Package with a single target to demonstrate basic coverage reporting.

## Structure

- **MyLibrary** - Simple math utilities
  - `Math.swift` - Basic arithmetic operations

## Coverage

Tests are intentionally incomplete (~70% coverage) to demonstrate threshold behavior.

## Usage

This sample is used by `.github/workflows/test-sample-single-target.yml` to test coverage reporting for packages with a single target.
